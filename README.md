# Awesome-Quantum-Recommendation
This repository is a curated collection of research papers, articles, and resources dedicated to the intersection of Quantum Computing and Recommender Systems.

As recommender systems face growing challenges in modeling complex user preferences, handling massive combinatorial spaces, and achieving true generative capabilities, quantum computing offers a fundamentally new paradigm. This repository gathers the pioneering work—from foundational concepts to the latest breakthroughs—that brings these ideas closer to reality.
